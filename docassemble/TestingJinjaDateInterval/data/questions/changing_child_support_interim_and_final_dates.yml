  interim_order_date is: ${interim_order_date}
 
  % if date_difference(starting=interim_order_date, ending=today()).days <= 10:
  It's been 10 days or less since the interim order 
  % else:
  It's been more than 10 days or less since the interim order
  % endif
  
  final_order_date is: ${final_order_date}
 
  % if date_difference(starting=final_order_date, ending=today()).days <= 10:
  It's been 10 days or less since the final order 
  % elif date_difference(starting=final_order_date, ending=today()).days > 10 and date_difference(starting=final_order_date, ending=today()).days <= 30:
